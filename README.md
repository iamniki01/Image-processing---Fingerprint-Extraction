# Image-processing
Image processing and Machine Learning are the technologies which is booming in this era. The vision-based applications have been used to extract fingerprints. Fingerprint detection is usual to pass the signal to the machine, for human unique identity. Here, the process of fingerprint extraction using web cam is developed and implemented. It is a part of the human machine interface to detect the fingertip. This method is involving the skin detection and preprocessing the binary image to extract only desired portion. Here, the process of generating the binary silhouette from the input using HSV color space-based skin filter. Later, the hand cropping and palm extraction is done based on the line function by considering approximate height and width
